# Project README

This repository contains various R scripts for modeling population dynamics. Below is a brief overview of each file:

## File Descriptions

- **Normal Nimble.R**: Implements a basic normal distribution model for annual population states, considering survival and birth processes.
- **Nimble SMC V2.R**: Uses Sequential Monte Carlo methods with exact annual birth and survival rates for detailed population modeling.
- **Population Kalmar(2).R**: Applies a Kalman Filter model with observation error based on 2021 Census data and process error from year-on-year changes.

## Other Files
- **.DS_Store**, **.Rhistory**: System-generated files for macOS and R session history.
