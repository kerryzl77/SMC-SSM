# Project README
This repository hosts a suite of R scripts designed to model population dynamics using state-space models and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Each script is tailored to specific model formulations and assumptions as detailed in the corresponding research paper. The scripts employ various probabilistic models to estimate and analyze the population states based on birth, death, and migration data.

## Model Implementations
- **Kalman Filter - Model 1.R: This script fits a linear Gaussian state-space model to population data using a Kalman filter. It initializes with a 'diffuse' covariance matrix and optimizes the process and observation noise parameters.

- **optimizeKalmanParams.R: Provides the optimization routine for the Kalman Filter's noise parameters using the BFGS algorithm.

- **SMC - PoisLogN.R (Model 2 - Poisson-Lognormal case): Implements a particle filter with a Poisson process for births and a log-normal observation model, reflecting the stochastic nature of population changes.

- **SMC - Bin.R (Model 2 - Binomial-Binomial case): A variant of the particle filter that uses binomial processes to simulate both survival and birth events in the population.

- **BF-Coded.R (Model 3): Corresponds to a hard-coded Bootstrap Filter implementation for a non-linear state-space model.

- **SMC bin dynamic rate.R: Demonstrates a dynamic birth and death rate model which could not be compiled due to excessive stochasticity.

## Data Sources and Methods
###Population Data
The data encompasses national and subnational population estimates for the UK, including births, deaths, and migration figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), the National Records of Scotland (NRS), and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) have provided this comprehensive dataset.

### Migration Data
Migration figures, an integral part of the state-space models, are derived from various sources and represent long-term migration data, as the UK does not have a population registration system.

## Other Files
- **.DS_Store & .Rhistory: These files are automatically generated by the macOS file system and the R software environment, respectively. They contain system-specific metadata and a log of commands executed in R.
